					<p>On this  site  you will  be  given the opportunity to learn
					 a great deal about some very important programming languages.
					 Throughout the course of  learning these  programming languages
					 you will  be exposed to a  sliver of the  Chinese Culture through 
					 their language. With every page depending on the content holds a 
					 phrase with relavance to the programming concept that we're covering.
					 </p>
				
					<p>				 In fact there is even a relevant phrase on this page to take note of.
					 <p>"性相近也，习相远也"</p>
					 <p>"Xing xiang jin ye, xi xiang yuan ye"</p>
					 <p>"By nature, men are nearly alike; but by practice, they are very diverse."                                 ~ Confucious</p>  
					<p> In the case of this site our methods of leanring are indeed differing from most!
					 Now that you know what this  site is about we can  continue on to learn some interesting things. </p>
					<p>We  know now that on this  site we will  be  learning in a very 
					unique way but what I  haven't  told you is  what  specifically we
					 will  be  learning. On this  site I  will  primarily  be covering 
					one language, Javascript. However, it is recommended that  you know 
					how to use HTML as well. It is  in that  way that you can truly realize 
					the power of  javascript.
					
					</p>
					<p>Many Chinese  phrases throughout the site are borrowed from the
					 philosopher of Confucius. In Chinese culture he is attributed to
					 the creation of their educational system through his wise sayings
					  and his own ability to teach. All that I hope  from the users of
					  this site is that you can learn something new or at the very 
					  least gain a new perspective</p>
					<p>On the next page we will look at some basic nonetheless important
					 functions that one should start with when designing a website. We  will look at functions such as:
					  </p>
					  <ul>
					  	<li>Page Load Verification,</li>
					  	<li>Drop Down List, and</li>
					  	<li>Image Gallery</li>

					  </ul>
